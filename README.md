# Project Title

Subscription-Based Expense & Tax Management Platform for Germany

---

## Project Overview

Develop a robust and secure Laravel application that provides individuals and small businesses in Germany with an intuitive platform for managing their monthly expenses and calculating their tax liabilities. The service will operate on a monthly subscription model, processed exclusively through PayPal. A key requirement is the ability to handle multi-language content (Arabic, English, and German) and ensure all tax calculations adhere to the latest German tax regulations for 2025.
