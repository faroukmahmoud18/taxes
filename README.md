# Subscription-Based Expense & Tax Management Platform for Germany

## Project Overview

This document outlines the project plan for developing a robust, secure, and user-friendly Laravel application. This platform will serve individuals and small businesses in Germany, offering an intuitive solution for managing monthly expenses and calculating tax liabilities. The service will operate on a monthly subscription model, with payments processed exclusively through PayPal. Key features include multi-language support (Arabic, English, German) and adherence to the latest German tax regulations for 2025, ensuring accuracy and compliance. The platform aims to simplify financial management and tax preparation for its users, providing them with clear insights and estimated calculations.

## Core Features & Functionality

The platform will be built around the following core features:

### 1. User Authentication & Authorization

Secure and reliable user management is paramount.

*   **User Registration:** New users can create an account by providing necessary details (e.g., name, email, password). Email verification will be implemented.
